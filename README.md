# Fleuron Collection

A collection of public domain fleurons. The bulk are from a book called *The Little Book of Typographical Ornaments* by David Jury (Laurence King Publishing, ISBN: 9781780675893)

Fleurons are a lost art, harkening back when books where an artistic medium. These books were more than just a means to convey, broadcast and store information.

Other book fleurons used:

1. *Illustrated Book of Patience Games* (1916), Professor Hoffman
2. *A Yorkshire Cookery Book* (5th edition, 1925), Mary Milnes Gaskell
